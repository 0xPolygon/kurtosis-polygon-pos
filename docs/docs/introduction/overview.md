# Overview

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Polygon PoS Kurtosis package documentation!

This project provides a modular, reproducible environment for developing, testing, and running [Polygon PoS](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/) devnets using [Kurtosis](https://kurtosis.com/).

Specifically, this package will:

1. Spin up a local L1 blockchain, fully customizable with multi-client support, leveraging the [Ethereum Kurtosis package](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package).
2. Deploy Polygon PoS contracts to L1 and stake for each validator.
3. Generate L2 consensus and execution layer genesis information.
4. Configure and launch a network of Polygon PoS nodes.

Optional features:

- Run a transaction spammer to simulate network load.
- Deploy monitoring solutions such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Panoptichain](https://github.com/0xPolygon/panoptichain) and [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com/) to observe the network.
